# Jquery KanBan Taskboard

[live site](https://anton-oz.github.io/KanBan-TaskBoard/)

## Description

I built this app to gain a better understanding of jqeury and jqeury ui. The app provides a nice polished interface for a simple to-do application. I learned that reading documentation and brainstorming different ways to approach a problem is beneficial if you are stuck on a problem. I ran into more than a few issues with this project, but everytime I decided to approach from a different angle it proved to be a good decision.

## Installation

## Usage

To use the site click the green "add task" button and fill out the form with task name, due date, and description. To submit the form click "add task" again and you will see the task added to the to do column. Add more tasks using the same process, and alter task progress by dragging tasks to different columns. To delete a task simply click the red "delete task" button on the corresponding task.
